### Definitions

To start things off, I want to give a few definitions:

*Lattice point:* a point whose coordinates are integers: p &#8714; &#8484;<sup>n</sup>.

*Hypersphere:* an n-dimensional shape of points within a distance r from a point p: {x | &#8721;<sup>n</sup><sub>i=0</sub> (x<sub>i</sub>-p<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup> &le; r<sup>2</sup>}.

*Hypercube:* an n-dimensional cube. Square in 2D, Cube in 3D.

*Polytope:* an n-dimensional polygon.


### Hypercubes: a low hanging fruit
Counting the lattice points in a hypercube is possible in linear time proportional to the number of dimensions. Consider the 2D case:

`Graphics[{Red, Rectangle[{-5, -5}, {5, 5}], Black, Point /@ Tuples[Range[-6, 6], 2]}]`
![Square graphed with lattice points](/files/squarelatticeeasy.svg)

The square has a side length of 10 and is centered at the origin. Because each of the vertices corresponds with a lattice point, the contained lattice points are a 2-dimensional range from the lower left corner (x&#8321;,y&#8321;) to the upper right corner (x&#8322;,y&#8322;): {(x,y) | x&#8714; \[x&#8321;,x&#8322;\], y&#8714; \[y&#8321;,y&#8322;\]}. The total point count is (x&#8322;-x&#8321;)(y&#8322;-y&#8322;). For this case, the number of lattice points is thus (5-(-5))(5-(-5))=100.

How about when the square's vertices are not lattice points?

`Graphics[{Red, Rectangle[{-5.5, -5.5}, {5.5, 5.5}], Black, Point /@ Tuples[Range[-6, 6], 2]}]`
![Square graphed with lattice points](/files/squarelattice.svg)

 This can be reduced this to the original case by taking the floor of the upper right corner and the ceiling of the lower left corner. Because all lattice points have integer values, they can only lie in this shrunken square: 
```
Graphics[{Red, Rectangle[{-5.5, -5.5}, {5.5, 5.5}], 
  Lighter@Red, Rectangle[{-5.5, -5.5} // Ceiling, {5.5, 5.5} // Floor],
  Black, Point /@ Tuples[Range[-6, 6], 2]}]
```
![Shrunk square graphed on top of original square](/files/squarelatticeshrunk.svg)

Rectangles also work with the above formulation. It applies to the 3D case by taking a 3D range. Formulated for the n-dimensional case: {(p&#8321;,p&#8322;,...,p<sub>n</sub>) | p&#8321;&#8714; \[r&#185;&#8321;,r&#185;&#8322;\], p&#8322;&#8714; \[r&#178;&#8321;,r&#178;&#8322;\],...,p<sub>n</sub>&#8714;\[r<sup>n</sup>&#8321;,r<sup>n</sup>&#8322;\]} where p is a lattice point and r is the range from the lowest to highest corner (superscript of r is the dimension here, sorry for any confusion).

#### Time analysis

Finding all the lattice points in an n-dimensional hypercube is O(n) due to the requirement of taking the floor and ceiling of the corners. Counting the lattice points in a hypercube thus also takes O(n) time.

### Hyperspheres: much harder

Counting the lattice points inside a hypersphere is not as simple. Consider the 2D case, known as the [Gauss circle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_circle_problem):

`Graphics[{Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 10], Black, Point /@ Tuples[Range[-10, 10], 2]}]`

![Circle graphed with lattice points](/files/circlelattice.svg)

There are a lot of methods that can work. One simple way is to take the escribed square, find the contained lattice points, and filter out those that do not lie in the circle.

`Graphics[{LightGray, Rectangle[{-10, -10}, {10, 10}], Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 10], Black, Point /@ Tuples[Range[-10, 10], 2]}]`

![Circle graphed with lattice points and an escribed square](/files/escribedsquare.svg)

Unfortunately, this does not perform too well. Each lattice point in the square has to be checked, taking O(r&#178;) time. It gets worse with higher dimensions, taking O(r<sup>n</sup>) time for the n-dimensional case.

Runtime can be improved by only testing on the lattice points between the inscribed square and the escribed square:

`Graphics[{LightGray, Rectangle[{-10, -10}, {10, 10}], Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 10], Darker@Red, Rectangle[{-10, -10}/Sqrt[2], {10, 10}/Sqrt[2]], Black, Point /@ Tuples[Range[-10, 10], 2]}]`

![Circle graphed with lattice points an escribed square, and an inscribed square](/files/escribedsquareandinscribedsquare.svg)

But this will still take O(r<sup>n</sup>) time. To improve this time bound, I tried and failed with many ideas including a [midpoint circle algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm) adaptation, flood filling, scanlines, and appoximating the circle as an inscribed regular polygon with n sides. In the end, I settled on a method that takes time proportional to the hypersurface and can be used to enumerate and count all points.

First, it finds the lattice points in the inscribed square. This of course involves the method described in the hypercube section, producing a shrunken inscribed square.

`Graphics[{Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 10], Darker@Red, Rectangle[{-10, -10}/Sqrt[2], {10, 10}/Sqrt[2]], Black, Point /@ Tuples[Range[-10, 10], 2], White, Large // PointSize, Point /@ Tuples[Range[Ceiling[-10/Sqrt[2]], Floor[10/Sqrt[2]]], 2]}]`

![Circle graphed with lattice points in the inscribed square highlighted](/files/inscribedsquarehighlightedlatticepoints.svg)

Then, to handle the remaining curved sections, it iterates over the sides of the shrunken inscribed square to build new ranges of points to add. For each point on a side, it solves the circle equation treating the constant dimension (y if the side is horizontal, x if vertical) as missing to find the corresponding point on the circle. The range of lattice points through the line perpendicular to the side from the side point to the circle point is then considered.

For the case of expanding up:
`Graphics[{Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 10], Darker@Red, Rectangle[{-10, -10}/Sqrt[2], {10, 10}/Sqrt[2]], Black, Point /@ Tuples[Range[-10, 10], 2], White, Large // PointSize, Point /@ Tuples[Range[Ceiling[-10/Sqrt[2]], Floor[10/Sqrt[2]]], 2], Point /@ Tuples[{{#}, Range[Floor[10/Sqrt[2]], y /. Solve[#^2 + y^2 == 10^2 && y > 0, y, Reals] // First // Floor]}] & /@ Range[Ceiling[-10/Sqrt[2]], Floor[10/Sqrt[2]]]}]`

Notably: `Point /@ Tuples[{{#}, Range[Floor[10/Sqrt[2]], y /. Solve[#^2 + y^2 == 10^2 && y > 0, y, Reals] // First // Floor]}] & /@ Range[Ceiling[-10/Sqrt[2]], Floor[10/Sqrt[2]]]`

![Circle graphed with lattice points in the inscribed square and above the inscribed square yet inside the circle highlighted](/files/inscribedsquareexpandedup.svg)

This is repeated for the other 3 sides of the rectangle. I [implemented the method for the 2D case in Mathematica](/files/circle_lattice.pdf). A few checks are included to double-check my implementation for enumeration, such as uniqueness of the points, whether they are in the circle, and a check for missing points. The way it is implemented gives all points at once rather than lazily enumerating them, so beware, *it may eat up all your RAM at a high radius!* There are a lot of neat tricks possible here like reflecting across the x and y axis, but this does not change the overall time complexity.


#### Time analysis

For the n-dimensional case, there are 2n faces to be checked, each with a hyperarea (?) of (2r/sqrt(d))<sup>d-1</sup>. This simplifies to O(2<sup>d</sup>d(r/sqrt(d))<sup>d-1</sup>), and further to O(2<sup>n</sup>n<sup>(3-n)/2</sup>r<sup>n-1</sup>). It takes a linear O(r) time for the 2D case and O(r&#178;) for the 3D case. The constant grows as dimensionality increases due to additional facets. The time taken is proportional to hypersphere surface area, which is 2<sup>n-1</sup>Ï€r<sup>n-1</sup>.

## Concluding Remarks

Thus, I have shown above a method for enumerating hypersphere lattice points that scales with hypersphere surface area. This is an improvement over the naive approach which scales with hypersphere volume. There are many other shapes worth investigating, like a polytope. Barvinok's algorithm, which finds the lattice points in a convex polytope in polynomial time, was implemented and improved by a team at UC Davis in the [LattE software package](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/).
